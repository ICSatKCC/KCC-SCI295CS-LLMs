**Downloaded Software:**

- **Ollama 3.2 1b**

Why choose Ollama?  
Ollama is a platform on which developers can run large language models locally. Ollama creates both text and image process capabilities. Ollama 3.2 includes the process to analyze images, support hand written recognition and image based questions \- answering. This is a great way to start, with students being our target audience, making it very easy for them to just upload images or take a picture of a certain date on the board and have it noted and accessible in Ollama. Ollama also includes a Python library it is able to summarize articles and generate less time-consuming tasks for students.

**Open webui docker**  
**Docker:**  
The Docker software is accessible to developers to package their applications into different containers to ensure consistent and portable execution across various environments. The advantages of Docker are:

1. Consistency   
2. Isolation- isolated environments that prevent conflicts between different applications or versions of software, which is beneficial if developers are managing multiple LLMs or other software dependencies.   
3. Portability- Dockerized applications can be easily deployed across multiple platforms without modifications.  
4. Scalability- Docker can be used with other different tools and applications to meet various workloads.

Summary:   
Initial Goal: Try and create a simple reminder for students   
Challenges: While downloading the software, the problem I encountered was having the latest Mac IOS software downloaded too. I downloaded the Ollama but then tried the Docker, and initially, it would stop, then continue, and only then did I realize that the problem was that my Mac was not up to date. When I was downloading Docker, I had to figure out which of the two options was right for my Mac. And had to download both. The software download was really just time-consuming, but overall, the YouTube videos helped a lot when it came down to these difficulties.   
Getting into the hang of what to do in these new softwares were really tricky because it was all new to me and it was difficult at first to see the correlation between the three softwares. But as I was reading more articles and more YouTube video, I just really needed to know how to start simple tasks and where I wanted to begin with this project.
