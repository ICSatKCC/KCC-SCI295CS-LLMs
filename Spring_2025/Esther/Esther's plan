SCI 295 - Spring25
Esther's plan
Exploring Large Language Models with Ollama, OpenWebUI, Docker, and n8n

Goal:
   The goal is to run a simple Large Language Model (LLM) on my personal laptop to better understand how it works. I plan to use Ollama, OpenWebUI, and Docker, and if time allows, I would also like to experiment with automation features using n8n.
Material Resources:
   - Ollama
   - OpenWebUI
   - Docker
   - n8n
   - YouTube tutorials and online research

Process:
   In the beginning, I will install Docker and set up the working environment. Then, I will run an LLM using Ollama and OpenWebUI. After that, I plan to experiment with n8n to connect the tools and try out automation features. Throughout the process, I will document any issues I encounter and how I solve them.
